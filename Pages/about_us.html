        <h1>What is Quantum Computing?</h1>
        <article>
        Imagine a device that its internal temperature is seven times colder than the north pole, which can reach −273.14°C; what we have mentioned is the quantum computer. But what is a quantum? The concept of quantum is related to quantum mechanics, which is a subfield of physics that studies a phenomenon at a micro-level, so quantum computers are an intersection among physics, mathematics, and computer science. In our daily use of computers, we always think that our regular computers can do amazing things. Still, we do not know what quantum computer can do; It can solve the hardest problems in just 3 seconds in contrast to regular machines that can take several years to resolve it. Furthermore, to stand a chance at solving some of these complex problems, we need these types of computers. Hence, we should know much more about the concept of a qubit, which is equivalent to a bit on our regular computers. We should also leverage some principles of quantum computing, such as (superposition, entanglement, interference), its structure, even more about the advantages of the quantum computer and what they can do.
